# Spoonful

ðŸ‘‹ Hello!

Welcome to Spoonful, a delicate take home challenge done in Rails.


### Getting Started

Project is developed using `ruby v2.5.1` and `rails v6.0.0`.
In order not to have problems on the way, please make sure you are on the correct versions as well.


First but not least, install bundler deps first:
```sh
$ bundle install
```

We are going to need some config variables set in runtime, so don't forget to copy `.env.example` as `.env`, and make sure you are providing correct credentials there.

Example `.env.example` file is as follows:
```sh
CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID=YOUR_SPACE_ID
CONTENTFUL_ENVIRONMENT_ID=YOUR_ENV_ID
CONTENTFUL_ACCESS_TOKEN=YOUR_SECRET
```


Although project actually does not use any database (contentful api is the source of truth), we still need to bootstrap our database with rails.

Now, letâ€™s bootstrap postgresql db and migrate to be able to start and test our app.

```sh
$ rails db:create --all
$ rails db:migrate
```

Before seeing it in action, let's run our tests and make sure everything is intact:

```sh
$ rails test
```

In case something goes wrong, let's remember that some tests are based on snapshots from actual Contentful Api, (using `vcr` gem), so either you should have relevant cassettes under `tests/cassettes` directory or you'll need to have access to actual Contentful Api.


If all tests are passing, then yey!.


Let's start our application with the usual stuff:
```sh
$ rails s
```


### Important Files

Let's try to visualize important files in the project directory for a second:
```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ Gemfile
â”œâ”€â”€ app
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ lib
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ contentful
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ entry.rb
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ entry_serializer.rb
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ contentful.rb
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ models
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ chef.rb
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ concerns
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ photo.rb
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ photo_file.rb
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ recipe.rb
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ tag.rb
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ views
â”‚Â Â      â”œâ”€â”€ recipes
â”‚Â Â      â””â”€â”€ shared
â”œâ”€â”€ config
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ initializers
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ contentful.rb
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ vcr.rb
â”œâ”€â”€ test
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ cassettes
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ lib
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ configuration_test.rb
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ contentful
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â      â””â”€â”€ entry_test.rb
```

So, a good start would be checking `test/lib` and `app/lib` directories.
Inside you are going to see the base core application and its logic.

Basically `contentful` module, serves as a wrapper to access Contentful Delivery Api, and its relevant entries.

It exposes two main functions as:

* `all!`: to get relevant collection for given entry name.
* `one!`: to get relevant resource for given entry id.

It expects `name:` and `model:` parameters on object initialization. `name:` maps to directly `content_type` for Contentful API, whereas `model:` params is used to serialize Api responses into `ActiveModel` (tableless) model objects.

Each given model should implement `class#to_model(params = {})` method, otherwise `Contentful::Entry` object initialization fails.

HTTP Requests are performed using `faraday` gem, and caching is only performed at that level using `faraday-http-cache`.

If you want to test if cache hits or misses on development environment, you can enable caching with:
```sh
$ rails dev:cache
```

Then you can see `cache hit, store` logs after you do `rails s`.

### Have more questions?

Great! I have more as well. Let's discuss this on a call :)
